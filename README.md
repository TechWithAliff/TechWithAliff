## ☁️ Cloud Curious. Learning AWS One Step at a Time.

### 👋🏻 Hi, I’m **Aliff**  
I'm a 19-year-old Cybersecurity student exploring **AWS Cloud** from scratch.

Right now, I’m a **complete beginner**.  
No certifications yet. No big projects.  
Just **real curiosity**, a lot of questions, and the drive to figure it out — **one concept at a time**.

When I first looked into AWS, I didn’t even know where to begin.  
Everything felt too advanced, too fast, and too complicated.  
It made me feel stuck. Like maybe cloud wasn't meant for beginners like me.

So I decided to **learn in public** and document every step.  
If you’re just starting too, **you’re in the right place**.

### 🎯 My Mission

> I created this space to share what I’m learning  
> while it’s still fresh, raw, and beginner-friendly.

Not polished. Not perfect.  
Just progress, made real and shared openly.
